NVIDIA HairWorks enables users to simulate and render hair and fur to provide a truly interactive game experience. The technology originates from multiple simulation and rendering technologies that NVIDIA has developed in the past. This combines rendering technologies for human hair (GDC 2008) as well as various simulation technologies shown in multiple events (Fur Demo - GDC2012). To make the hair/fur technologies a product, NVIDIA engineers have put together these existing technologies and added new techniques to ensure a smooth pipeline for a variety of characters and deformation.
