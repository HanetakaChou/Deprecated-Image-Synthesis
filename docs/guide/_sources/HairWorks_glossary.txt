* **Gravity**

  - What goes up, must come down. The direction for gravity relative to fur.

  - The width of the root of each fur strand. This value is multiplied by the Width control

    - A value range of 0(thin) to 1(wide) can be used. 

    - A black and white control texture can be used as multiplier. 

* **Shadow Attenuation**

  - Define.

* **Specular Color**

  - The color(RGB) that is applied to primary and secondary specular components.

* **Specular Primary Scale**

  - The strength of the primary specular component. 

    - A value range of 0 to 1can be used. 

* **Specular Primary Shininess**

  - The strength of the fall off for the primary specular component. 

    - A value range of 0 (soft falloff) to 1(hard falloff) can be used. 

* **Specular Secondary Scale**

  - The strength of the secondary specular component. The secondary specular pattern or hot spots can be slightly different from the primary.

    - A value range of 0 to 1 can be used. 

* **Specular Secondary Shininess**

  - The strength of the fall off for the secondary specular component. 

    - A value range of 0 (soft falloff) to 1(hard falloff) can be used. 

* **Specular Secondary Tangent Offset**

  - The strength for how much the secondary specular component will be offset from the primary specular component based on the lighting direction. 

    - A value range of -1 to 1 can be used. 0 is the default and would line up with the primary specular component. 

* **Tip Width Scale**

  - The width of the tip of each fur strand. This value is multiplied by the Width control

    - A value range of 0(thin) to 1(wide) can be used. 

    - A black and white control texture can be used as multiplier. 

* **Waviness Frequency**

  - The strength of Waviness Frequency applied to each fur strand.

    - A value range of 1(1 sin wave ) to 10(10 sin waves applied) can be used. 

* **Waviness Frequency Noise**

  - The strength of noise applied to Waviness Frequency for each fur strand.

* **Wind Noise**
 
  - The strength of random noise applied to Wind. This generates a random oscillation on the fur that respects wind direction if one is applied.
