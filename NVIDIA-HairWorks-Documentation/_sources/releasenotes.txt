Known Limitations
------------------

* No multi material support for any mesh type in the HairWorks viewer.

* Currently there is no support for adding extra animation files via fbx in the HairWorks viewer.

* Shadows may flicker a bit depending on the asset in HairWorks viewer. This is due to shadow resolution and depends on the shadow sampling techniques used in a given game engine.

* Guide hairs must be placed on the vertex of a growth mesh. DCC plug ins will move guides to closest vertex if they are not properly aligned.

* Only one guide per vertex is supported. Extra guides on vertex will be ignored at export.

* Number of cv/knot sampling per guide hair is the same per asset. Sampling is adjusted in DCC.

* Hair Interaction does not opperate between hairs of different assets.

* Alpha sorting is not supported.  So the root alpha feature must be used with limited range.

* The viewer currently supports only one character. However the character can have multiple hair assets.
